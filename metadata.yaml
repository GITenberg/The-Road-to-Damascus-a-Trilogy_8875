description: Swedish writer August Strinberg played a major role in introducing a
  more modernist sensibility into his native country's literature, producing several
  major novels and plays that are still regarded as some of the most significant works
  of twentieth-century Swedish literature. The Road to Damascus is a dramatic trilogy
  that broke new ground in stagecraft and characterization, touching on complex themes
  of spirituality and selfhood in the process.
